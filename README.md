# Python for Atmosphere and Ocean Scientists

The repository contains the [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/) lesson materials
for a single day workshop on using python (and git) in the atmosphere and ocean sciences:
[https://carpentrieslab.github.io/python-aos-lesson/](https://carpentrieslab.github.io/python-aos-lesson/)

The lesson materials were written by [Damien Irving](https://damienirving.github.io/) based on experiences
from teaching generic Software Carpentry workshops at the annual conference of the
Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society (AMOS) from 2014-2017.

The lesson materials have been used in the following workshops and university courses:  
* [Data Carpentry workshop at the 2018 AMOS Conference](https://damienirving.github.io/2018-02-04-amos-icshmo/), February 2018
* [Data Carpentry workshop at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution](https://damienirving.github.io/2018-08-15-whoi/), August 2018
* Changing Global Environments, 3rd year undergraduate subject, University of Wollongong, Semester 2, 2018
* [Data Carpentry workshop at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology](https://damienirving.github.io/2019-05-23-bom/), May 2019
* [Data Carpentry workshop at the 2019 AMOS Conference](https://damienirving.github.io/2019-06-10-amos/), June 2019
* [Data Carpentry workshop at the 2020 AMOS Conference](https://damienirving.github.io/2020-02-09-amos/), February 2020

An overview of the development of the lesson materials and plans for the future
was delivered during the Python Symposium at the 2020 Annual Meeting of the
American Meteorological Society
(see [video recording](https://ams.confex.com/ams/2020Annual/videogateway.cgi/id/521844?recordingid=521844)).
